# ICMP_requests
The provided Python script is a network scanning tool using the Scapy library. It sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to a range of IP addresses within the subnet 192.168.1.0/24. The script records the responses, showing details of successful packets and logging the corresponding IP addresses to a file called "Existing_ip.txt". The script also includes a timestamp for each packet and handles interruptions (e.g., keyboard interrupt) gracefully.
Im looking forward to doing more with this project like, for example, taking in user input, crafting and sending packets of various protocols, etc.
